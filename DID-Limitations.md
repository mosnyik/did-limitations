# DID Limitations



### What is DID

[DID](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#referring-to-verification-methods) refer to a pseudo-anonymous way of identifying a person, company, or object using a private key. To create a DID, users would create a self-sovereign identity and generate a pair of private and public keys. The generated public key is associated with the owner of the DID and the private key is used to prove ownership of the credentials associated with the public key.

DIDs have alot of promises for making life easer for both users and enterprises as it proposes to make processes faster, convinient and more efficient. It however comes with some limitations and that is what we are going to consider in this short write up.

### LIMITATIONS OF DID

- **Adoption issue** : With an estimated population of about [8 billion people](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/wpp2022_summary_of_results.pdf), and more than half of those using various digital products, there needs to be a large-scale buy-in to get the technology to mainstream adoption. Technology giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook etc would need to incorporate the system into their products to get it to speedy and broad adoption.


- **Exclusion** : For mass adoption, we look at the poor nations of the world to also be able to afford to key into this technology revolution, but the gadgets required to make use of these services are relatively expensive and would not reach the grassroots just yet


- **Education** : Being a new piece of technology, blockchain is not quite yet intuitive to most of its users as such, and it is paramount for users to be able to grant/restrict permissions to what credentials they want to share per time.
